# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to practice and become more proficient in the concepts I have learned in Module 6: Server-Side APIs of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to apply what I have learned in class about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third-party APIs, Server-Side APIs, etc., to a real web application. Creating my own Weather Dashboard from scratch allowed me to advance my skills and enlightened me to the areas that I need to improve upon.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use Javascript to retrieve the current date and time, use a Third-Party API to style my web page (Bootstrap), use a Server-Side API to , and more. These capabilities helped me to dynamically increase the functionality of my web application through JavaScript.

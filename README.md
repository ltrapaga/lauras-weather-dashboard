# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to practice and become more proficient in the concepts I have learned in Module 6: Server-Side APIs of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to apply what I have learned in class about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third-party APIs, Server-Side APIs, etc., to a real web application. Creating my own Weather Dashboard from scratch allowed me to advance my abilities and reflect on the skills that need improvement.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use Javascript to retrieve the current date and time, use a Third-Party API to style my web page (Bootstrap), use a Server-Side API to fetch applicable data (OpenWeatherMap), and more. Exchanging data between two software systems with APIs helped me to develop new features and increase the functionality of my web application.
